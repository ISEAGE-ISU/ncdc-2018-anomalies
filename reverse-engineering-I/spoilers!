The way to solve this crackme was to open the file in a disassembler and examine the entrypoint function. 
There you will find the dynamic assembly of a string that starts off by appending a space to "bios", 
followed by appending 'i' and 's', etc... until the solution string 'bios is better' is built. 
You can then test this by running the EFI program in QEMU under a UEFI shell
